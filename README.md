## 🖼️ VisionExtract: Subject Isolation from Images

A deep learning–based image segmentation system that automatically extracts the main subject from an image and removes the background. The output preserves the subject exactly as in the original image while turning everything else completely black. Built with PyTorch and modern segmentation architectures.

## 📘 About This Project

VisionExtract focuses on semantic segmentation to isolate the primary subject in an image. Given any input image, the model predicts a pixel-wise binary mask that separates the subject from the background, enabling clean subject extraction.

This project is useful for photography automation, digital art, AR/VR pipelines, virtual backgrounds, and content creation workflows.

### 🔍 Features

🧠 Automatic subject detection using deep learning

🎯 Pixel-wise segmentation with binary masks

⬛ Background removal with blacked-out pixels

🖼️ Preserves original subject details and colors

🔁 Supports real-world images beyond the training set
